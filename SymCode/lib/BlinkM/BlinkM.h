 *  Actuator Interface - Header File
 *  ------------------------------------
 *  Describes an actuator that receives one signal line (DC || PWM)
 *  An actuator is its own controller; outside controllers activate its behaviors. 
 *  For now, a behavior is defined as a sequence of integers [0, 1000]
 *  It regulates its own voltage thresholds
